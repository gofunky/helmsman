# install releases 

You can run helmsman with the [example.toml](https://github.com/gofunky/helmsman/blob/master/example.toml) or [example.yaml](https://github.com/gofunky/helmsman/blob/master/example.yaml) file.

``` 

$ helmsman -apply -f example.toml

# delete releases 

You can then change your desire, for example to disable the Jenkins release that was created above by setting `enabled = false` :

Then run Helmsman again and it will detect that you want to delete Jenkins:

> Note: deleting the jenkins app entry in example.toml WILL NOT resultin deleting the jenkins release. It simply means that Helmsman is no longer responsible for managing it.

If you would like the release to be deleted along with its history, you can use the `purge` flag in your desired state file as follows:

> NOTE: purge deleting a release means you can't roll it back.

```toml
[apps]

    [apps.jenkins]
    name = "jenkins" 
    description = "jenkins"
    namespace = "staging" 
    enabled = false # this tells helmsman to delete it 
    chart = "stable/jenkins" 
    version = "0.9.1" 
    valuesFile = "" 
    purge = true # this means purge delete this release whenever it is required to be deleted 
    test = false
``` 

```yaml
apps:
  jenkins:
    name: "jenkins"
    description: "jenkins"
    namespace: "staging"
    enabled: false # this tells helmsman to delete it
    chart: "stable/jenkins"
    version: "0.9.1"
    valuesFile: ""
    purge: true # this means purge delete this release whenever it is required to be deleted
    test: false
```

# rollback releases 

Similarly, if you change `enabled` back to `true`, it will figure out that you would like to roll it back.

# upgrade releases

Everytime you run Helmsman, (unless the release is [protected or deployed in a protected namespace](protect_namespaces_and_releases.md)) it will upgrade existing deployed releases to the version you specified in the desired state file. It also applies the `values.yaml` file you specify with each install/upgrade. This means that when you don't change anything for a specific release, Helmsman would upgrade with the `values.yaml` file you provide (just in case it is a new file or you changed something there.)

If you change the chart, the existing release will be deleted and a new one with the same name will be created using the new chart.
